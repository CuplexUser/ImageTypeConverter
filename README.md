# ImageTypeConverter
Batch Image Converter

The project is in its infancy, meaning that no functionality exists yet to use the nuget packages ImageProcessor and its plugins.
For example a Webp image format plugin 

This is just a temporary Readme before base functionality is implemented and there is actually something to writer about.
